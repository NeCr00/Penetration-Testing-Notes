Metasploit allows you to quickly identify some critical vulnerabilities that could be considered as “low hanging fruit”.  The term “low hanging fruit” usually refers to easily identifiable and exploitable vulnerabilities that could potentially allow you to gain a foothold on a system and, in some cases, gain high-level privileges such as root or administrator.

Finding vulnerabilities using Metasploit will rely heavily on your ability to scan and fingerprint the target. The better you are at these stages, the more options Metasploit may provide you. For example, if you identify a VNC service running on the target, you may use the `search` function on Metasploit to list useful modules. The results will contain payload and post modules. At this stage, these results are not very useful as we have not discovered a potential exploit to use just yet. However, in the case of VNC, there are several scanner modules that we can use.

Example: VNC scanning modules

```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/ard_root_pw    use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login      use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/
```

  

You can use the `info` command for any module to have a better understanding of its use and purpose.

Description:
  This module will test a VNC server on a range of machines and report 
  successful logins. Currently it supports RFB protocol version 3.3, 
  3.7, 3.8 and 4.001 using the VNC challenge response authentication 
  method.

As you can see, the `vnc_login` module can help us find login details for the VNC service.

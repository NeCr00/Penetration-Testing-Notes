## R-Services

R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP. Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (`CSRG`) at the University of California, Berkeley, `r-services` were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (`SSH`) protocols and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. Much like `telnet`, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (`MITM`) attacks.

`R-services` span across the ports `512`, `513`, and `514` and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as `r-commands`. They are most commonly used by commercial operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX. While less common nowadays, we do run into them from time to time during our internal penetration tests so it is worth understanding how to approach them.

The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

Each command has its intended functionality; however, we will only cover the most commonly abused `r-commands`. The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands, including the service daemon they interact with, over what port and transport method to which they can be accessed, and a brief description of each.

|**Command**|**Service Daemon**|**Port**|**Transport Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`rcp`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.|
|`rsh`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.|
|`rexec`|`rexecd`|512|TCP|Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
|`rlogin`|`rlogind`|513|TCP|Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|

The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

#### /etc/hosts.equiv

  /etc/hosts.equiv

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.equiv

# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of `r-commands`, let's do some quick footprinting using `Nmap` to determine if all necessary ports are open.

#### Scanning for R-Services

  Scanning for R-Services

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2

#### Access Control & Trusted Relationships

The primary concern for `r-services`, and one of the primary reasons `SSH` was introduced to replace it, is the inherent issues regarding access control for these protocols. R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to. By default, these services utilize [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://web.mit.edu/rhel-doc/5/RHEL-5-manual/Deployment_Guide-en-US/ch-pam.html) for user authentication onto a remote system; however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files on the system. The `hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files contain a list of hosts (`IPs` or `Hostnames`) and users that are `trusted` by the local host when a connection attempt is made using `r-commands`. Entries in either file can appear like the following:

**Note:** The `hosts.equiv` file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas `.rhosts` provides a per-user configuration.

#### Sample .rhosts File

  Sample .rhosts File

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ cat .rhosts

htb-student     10.0.17.5
+               10.0.17.10
+               +
```

As we can see from this example, both files follow the specific syntax of `<username> <ip address>` or `<username> <hostname>` pairs. Additionally, the `+` modifier can be used within these files as a wildcard to specify anything. In this example, the `+` modifier allows any external user to access r-commands from the `htb-student` user account via the host with the IP address `10.0.17.10`.

Misconfigurations in either of these files can allow an attacker to authenticate as another user without credentials, with the potential for gaining code execution. Now that we understand how we can potentially abuse misconfigurations in these files let's attempt to try logging into a target host using `rlogin`.

#### Logging in Using Rlogin

  Logging in Using Rlogin

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student

Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost

[htb-student@localhost ~]$
```

We have successfully logged in under the `htb-student` account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the `.rhosts` file. Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the `rwho` command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho

  Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ rwho

root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25       
```

From this information, we can see that the `htb-student` user is currently authenticated to the `workstn01` host, whereas the `root` user is authenticated to the `web01` host. We can use this to our advantage when scoping out potential usernames to use during further attacks on hosts over the network. However, the `rwho` daemon periodically broadcasts information about logged-on users, so it might be beneficial to watch the network traffic.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers

To provide additional information in conjunction with `rwho`, we can issue the `rusers` command. This will give us a more detailed account of all logged-in users over the network, including information such as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).

  Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ rusers -al 10.0.17.5

htb-student     10.0.17.5:console          Dec 2 19:57     2:25
```

As we can see, R-services are less frequently used nowadays due to their inherent security flaws and the availability of more secure protocols such as SSH. To be a well-rounded information security professional, we must have a broad and deep understanding of many systems, applications, protocols, etc. So, file away this knowledge about R-services because you never know when you may encounter them.

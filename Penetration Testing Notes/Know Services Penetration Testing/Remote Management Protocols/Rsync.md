[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

Let's do a bit of quick footprinting. We can see that Rsync is in use using protocol 31.

#### Scanning for Rsync

  Scanning for Rsync

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0058s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.13 seconds
```

#### Probing for Accessible Shares

We can next probe the service a bit to see what we can gain access to.

  Probing for Accessible Shares

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
dev            	Dev Tools
@RSYNCD: EXIT
```

#### Enumerating an Open Share

Here we can see a share called `dev`, and we can enumerate it further.

  Enumerating an Open Share

```shell-session
0xNecr0@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

receiving incremental file list
drwxr-xr-x             48 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:34:50 build.sh
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:36:02 secrets.yaml
drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh

sent 25 bytes  received 221 bytes  492.00 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
```

From the above output, we can see a few interesting files that may be worth pulling down to investigate further. We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command `rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev`. If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or `-e "ssh -p2222"` if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh) is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.
